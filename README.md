## Appointment System UI
This is a User Interface for an Appointment System (this example uses data for a fictional veterinary) made in React.js using Hooks and functional components, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

To run this project locally you need to have Node.js and npm installed. If you don't have Node you can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
To open a development server and explore the interface, open a terminal in the project folder and run the 'npm start' command. This will open a server at http://localhost:3000/
